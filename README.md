# Cake-management-system
Description:
- Developed a scalable and modular cake shop management system using object-oriented design principles, such as inheritance and abstraction, to ensure code reusability and maintainability.
- Implemented an abstract Cake class as the base for different cake flavors, utilizing derived classes (GenoiseCake, ChiffonCake, ChocolateCake, VanillaCake) to encapsulate flavor-specific behavior while promoting code extensibility for future flavors.
- Designed customer interfaces (Customer, RegularCustomer, PremiumCustomer, NewCustomer) to handle customer details and discount calculations, providing a flexible structure for accommodating different customer types.
- Leveraged polymorphism to enable dynamic method binding, allowing for flexible and efficient price calculations based on the cake size and customer type.
- Utilized Java data structures, including maps and lists, to efficiently manage cake availability, quantities, and customer records, ensuring optimal performance and ease of data management.
- Employed encapsulation principles to encapsulate cake and customer data, providing secure access through getter methods while maintaining data integrity.
